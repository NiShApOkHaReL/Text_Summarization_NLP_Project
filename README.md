## Features

- **Extractive Summarization:** This tool uses an extractive summarization approach, which selects and condenses the most important sentences from the input text to create a summary.

- **Stopwords and Punctuation Handling:** The tool removes common stopwords and punctuation from the text to focus on meaningful content during the summarization process.

- **Word Frequency-Based Scoring:** It calculates word frequencies in the input text and assigns scores to sentences based on the frequency of important words.

- **Customizable Summary Length:** You can control the length of the generated summary by specifying the desired percentage of the original text's length.
